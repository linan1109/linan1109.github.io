## About Me
Hi, I'm Nan, a PhD student in Data Science at the [University of Zurich (UZH)][uzh-home].
I hold an MSc in Computer Science (Informatik) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, also from [UZH][uzh-home]. 
Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Beihang University (BUAA)][buaa-home] in Beijing.

My research focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to address real-world challenges while emphasizing their interpretability and explainability. 
I’m also deeply interested in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering, exploring how AI can be made more intuitive and accessible for everyone.
